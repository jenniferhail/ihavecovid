# A website for people who have Covid

Project board: https://github.com/users/jenniferhail/projects/3/views/1

## What is this?

Two days ago (September 12, 2023), I had the idea to check for the domain ihavecovid.com. I was shocked to find that it was still available, so I bought it for $9 and decided that I’m going to make a fun little side project with it!

For now I’m whipping up a simple landing page, but I’m picturing this to be a resource for people who have Covid. Like a link directory that points you to fun activities, virtual games to play with friends while you're isolated and maybe even quick links to order masks and Covid tests.

Think of this site as an online convenience store to make your life easier while you’re sick.

## My Goals

I aim to make a quirky, but useful site that I can use to improve on my skills as a frontend developer, try new things I've been wanting to learn and build my first public project.

Who knows where this will go, but it would be amazing if it became a community-built project.

## How to Help

Does this sound like something you want to work on? If so, check out the tickets and pick one that you like. This project is brand new, so there's lots to learn and more to come.

Do you have an idea for this site? Do you want to help with writing, brainstorming, or designing? If so, create a new issue and join the fun!

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
